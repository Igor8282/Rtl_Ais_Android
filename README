rtl_ais_android

Brings the rtl_ais to the Android plattform



Is an application that allows you to send NMEA message in your Android applications or to other applications.
Sending is done via UDP network stream

All you need is to launch an intent in the form "iqsrc://rtl_tcp_arguments" where you replace rtl_tcp_arguments with the arguments that you want your application to run rtl_tcp with and the magic will be done behind the scenes! More HOWTO coming soon!
