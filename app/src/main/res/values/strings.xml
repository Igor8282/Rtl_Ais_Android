	    <h2>What is that</h2>
	    <p>This application is a port of rtl_ais to the android platform. It allows other applications to start rtl_ais and use the decoded NEMA messages that it reads from
	    USB DVB-T dongles based on the RTL2832U chip</p>
	    <p>The application is based on the rtl_tcp_andro driver from Martin Marinov
	    <p>It also allows to stream over the network directly from the UI of the driver. This is an advanced feature and there could be bugs.</p>
